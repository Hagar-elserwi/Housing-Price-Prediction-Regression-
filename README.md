# 🏠 Housing Price Prediction
**Machine Learning | Regression | Data Analysis**

## 📌 The Challenge
Predicting the market value of homes based on features like room count, location, and local tax rates. This project focuses on minimizing the error between predicted and actual prices.

## 🛠️ Technical Approach
* **Type:** Multi-variate Linear Regression.
* **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values and removed outliers that skewed the pricing trends.
* **Metric:** Focused on **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** to understand the average dollar-amount deviation.

## 📊 Key Results
* **R-Squared:** [e.g., 0.78] — Explaining 78% of the variance in housing prices.
